          Tailwind CSS is a popular and <span class="italic text-blue-500">powerful CSS framework </span>that
          provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to quickly
          and easily style HTML elements. The framework is designed to be highly
          customizable, allowing developers to easily create custom styles and
          layouts without having to write CSS from scratch.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
          consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
          can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
          ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
          <span class="font-bold"> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2">
          Examples of such utility classes includes the
          <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
          while the <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a light
          gray background color to an element.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4 p-4 bg-gradient-to-b from-green-400 to-blue-400">
          Overall, Tailwind CSS is a great choice for developers looking for a
          powerful and customizable CSS framework that promotes consistency in
          design and makes it easy to create responsive designs.
